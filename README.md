NRC Cape Creator
This project is a simple web app that lets you design your own Minecraft‑style cape and Elytra textures. Instead of editing images manually, you can load a template in the browser, drop in your artwork, choose colors or gradients, and instantly see the result.

The app uses the HTML5 canvas to layer your images on top of a cape template. You can color the base, add front and back designs, and even mask Elytra wings so they fit perfectly. When you’re happy with the look, you just click Download Cape and get a ready‑to‑use PNG file.

It’s meant to be lightweight: open the page, play with the controls, and create a custom cape in minutes — no extra software needed.
